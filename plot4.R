#Part of code for Project-1 of Exploratory Data Analysis
#
#--------------------
# Written to plot the plot-4 of the project
#--------------------
# 1) Download and unzip Data from URL if not already downloaded
# 2) Read Data into R
#		For this, to make reading faster, do the following :
#		a) Capture the classes for data
#		b) Compute the number of rows of data using unix command wc. May not work on windows machine. 
# 3) Subset data to use only the rows corresponding to two specified dates
# 4) Launch png graphics device
# 5) plot required graph using neceaasry command/commands.
# 6) close the launched graphic device
